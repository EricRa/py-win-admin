# py-win-admin

## Useful system admin scripts for Windows written in Python and utilizing Powershell cmdlets

### Script list and info

A list of scripts available in this repo along with descriptions will be kept the script_descriptions.md file in the root repo directory.

### Usage

Each script file will contain a comment section at the top listing:
- Description and purpose
- Usage info
- Additional dependencies needed(if any)



### Dependencies needed for all scripts:

- Python 3.5+ 
    - (Tested with python 3.9, but these should be backward compatible at least this far back)
    - These will generally only use packages from the Python Standard Library.  If any additional python packages are needed, they will be listed in the comments at the top of the script file.
- Powershell 5.0+
    - This version or above comes by default with Windows 10, so this should already be installed.
    - To check your version, open powershell and type:
    > $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
